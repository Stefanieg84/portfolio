2024-02-01,sql_analytics,4,"Consistently designing dimensional models that enable both detailed analysis and executive rollups. Comfortable with complex grain decisions and slowly changing dimensions."
2024-02-01,power_bi,4,"Building production dashboards with defensible DAX measures. Strong understanding of evaluation context and filter propagation. Still learning advanced calculation groups."
2024-02-01,internal_audit,4,"Leading full audit cycles from planning through reporting. Risk-based approach is now instinctive. Comfortable challenging management when evidence doesn't support their assertions."
2024-02-01,exec_synthesis,4,"Translating technical findings into decision-ready insights is now routine. Can adjust messaging for different audiences without losing accuracy."
2024-02-01,stakeholder_mgmt,4,"Facilitating alignment between technical and business stakeholders. Better at reading room dynamics and adapting approach in real-time."
2024-02-01,python_data,3,"Building reliable data pipelines. Still referring to documentation for advanced pandas operations. Need more practice with async patterns."
2024-02-01,grc_frameworks,3,"Applying frameworks like COSO and ISO. Good theoretical understanding but still building pattern recognition for when to adapt vs follow strictly."
2024-02-01,enterprise_arch,3,"Can map changes across BDAT planes. TOGAF concepts are solid. Less experienced with large-scale architecture governance."
2024-02-01,time_series,3,"Comfortable with decomposition and basic forecasting. Need deeper understanding of advanced models like ARIMA for complex seasonality."
2024-02-01,dbt_workflows,2,"Building basic models and tests. Understanding incremental models. Not yet comfortable with advanced macros or packages."
2024-02-01,docker_containers,2,"Can build and run containers. Basic compose setups. Haven't done production orchestration or advanced networking."
2024-02-01,sustainable_dev,2,"Strong conceptual understanding from MSc coursework. Less practical experience applying sustainability frameworks to tech projects."
2024-02-01,azure_agents,1,"Recent hackathon exposure. Understand basic concepts. Haven't built anything production-ready."
2024-01-01,sql_analytics,4,"Same level as Feb - consistent practice"
2024-01-01,power_bi,4,"Same level as Feb - active projects"
2024-01-01,python_data,3,"Same level - gradual improvement through practice"
2023-12-01,sql_analytics,4,"Promoted from level 3 after cross-border spend project demonstrated ability to handle complex dimensional modeling"
2023-12-01,internal_audit,4,"Same level - maintaining through regular practice"
2023-11-01,enterprise_arch,3,"Promoted from level 2 after successfully leading governed analytics platform design"
2023-10-01,time_series,3,"Promoted from level 2 after breach detection model success"
